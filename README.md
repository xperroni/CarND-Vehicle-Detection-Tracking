# Pipeline for Vehicle Identification and Localization (PipeVIaL)

The Pipeline for Vehicle Identification and Localization (PipeVIaL) implements a solution to Project 5 of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer nanodegree â€“ namely, detection and tracking of vehicles in a video recorded from a front-mounted camera on a car traveling down a road. It works by performing the following operations on video image frames:

1. Compute a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) from input images;
2. Train a classifier to distinguish vehicle from non-vehicle image segments using their HOG's as inputs;

## Implementation



### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) Computation

The [Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients) is a feature descriptor useful for object identification tasks. The [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/) library provides an [implementation](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.feature.html#skimage.feature.hog) that enables several feature parameters to be set.
